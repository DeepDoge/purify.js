## Installation üçô

To install **purify.js**, follow the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/DeepDoge/purify.js/releases).

## Examples

### purify.js + ShadowRoot üç§

```ts
import { css, fragment, ref, tags } from "@purifyjs/purify"

const { div, button } = tags

function App() {
    return div({ id: "app" }).children(Counter())
}

function Counter() {
    const host = div()
    const shadow = host.element.attachShadow({ mode: "open" })

    const count = ref(0)
    const double = count.derive((count) => count * 2)

    shadow.append(
        fragment(
            button({ class: "my-button", "data-count": count })
                .onclick(() => count.val++)
                .children("Count:", count),
            ["Double:", double],
        ),
    )
    return host
}

document.body.append(App().element)
```

## Why Not JSX Templating? üçï

-   **Lack of Type Safety**: An `<img>` element created with JSX cannot have the `HTMLImageElement` type because all JSX elements must return the same type. This causes issues if you expect a `HTMLImageElement` some where in the code but all JSX returns is `HTMLElement` or something like `JSX.Element`. Also, it has some other issues related to the generics, discriminated unions and more.

-   **Build Step Required**: JSX necessitates a build step, adding complexity to the development workflow. In contrast, **purify.js** avoids this, enabling a simpler and more streamlined development process by working directly with native JavaScript and TypeScript.

-   **Attributes vs. Properties**: In **purify.js**, I can differentiate between attributes and properties of an element while building it, which is not currently possible with JSX. This distinction enhances clarity and control when defining element characteristics.

## Current Limitations ü¶Ä

-   **Lifecycle and Reactivity**: Currently, I use Custom Elements to detect if an
    element is connected to the DOM. This means:

    -   Every element created by the `tags` proxy, are Custom Elements. But they
        look like normal `<div>`(s) and `<span>`(s) and etc on the DevTools, because
        they extend the original element and use the original tag name. This way we
        can follow the life cycle of every element. And it works amazingly.
    -   But we also have signals, which might not return an HTMLElement. So we gotta
        wrap signals with something in the DOM. So we can follow its lifecycle and
        know where it starts and ends. Traditionally this is done via `Comment`
        `Node`(s). But there is no feasible and sync way to follow a `Comment`
        `Node` on the DOM while also allowing direct DOM manipulation
        ([DOM#533](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/533)). So instead of
        `Comment` `Node`(s), I used Custom Elements with `display: contents` style
        to wrap signal renders. This way, I can follow the lifecycle of the signal
        render in the DOM, and decide to follow or unfollow the signal. Since signal
        render itself is an `Element` this approach has limitations, such as
        `.parent > *` selector wouldn't select all children if some are inside a
        signal.

        As another solution to this, a `HTMLElement` or `Element` attribute similar
        to `inert` that hides the element from the query selector both in JS and CSS
        would also be useful.

But as long as the developer is aware of this limitation or difference, it
shouldn't cause any issues.
